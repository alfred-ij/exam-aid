Welcome to the soaFamL branch of the Long-term Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics dashboard project! This repository hosts the development of an interactive dashboard designed to aid actuarial students and professionals in understanding complex actuarial concepts through a modern data science approach.

§1: Overview

The soaFamL branch integrates traditional actuarial practices with modern data science techniques, leveraging the power of Shiny dashboards to create an interactive learning environment. This project is inspired by the Long-Term Actuarial Mathematics (LTAM) course and aims to transform actuarial modeling by enhancing the modularity, reusability, and scalability of models through object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in R.

Prelude

Welcome to the Long-term Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics dashboard! Using the 5 W's framework (What, Why, How, Who, and When), this dashboard clarifies its purpose, scope, and benefits:

What: An examination, study, and learning assistant for actuarial topics, adapted from the latest Society of Actuaries (SOA) syllabus.
Why: Combines traditional actuarial science with modern data science techniques, enhancing comprehension and retention of complex concepts.
How: Implemented through Shiny dashboards, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Who: Beneficial for actuarial students, educators, and data science enthusiasts.
When: Usable at any point in the actuarial learning journey.
