## Welcome to the Long-term Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics (LTAM) Dashboard Project Repository!

This repository is dedicated to pioneering interactive educational tools that integrate actuarial science with cutting-edge data science techniques. Our mission is to transform actuarial education by providing dynamic and user-friendly resources that enhance learning and application of complex concepts. By leveraging the power of Shiny dashboards, we aim to make actuarial studies more engaging, intuitive, and accessible for students, educators, and professionals alike.

### Overview

The LTAM branch (soaFamL) is the first in a series of initiatives within this repository, setting the stage for future projects. It exemplifies our approach by combining traditional actuarial methods with modern data science, creating a robust, interactive learning platform. This branch focuses on key areas such as survival models, life-contingent products, and policy values, offering a comprehensive study aid that aligns with the Society of Actuaries (SOA) syllabus.
