# Welcome to the soaFamL branch of the Long-term Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics dashboard project! 

- This repository hosts the development of an interactive dashboard designed to aid actuarial students and professionals in understanding complex actuarial concepts through a modern data science approach.

## Overview

- The soaFamL branch integrates traditional actuarial practices with modern data science techniques, leveraging the power of Shiny dashboards to create an interactive learning environment. This project is inspired by the Long-Term Actuarial Mathematics (LTAM) course and aims to transform actuarial modeling by enhancing the modularity, reusability, and scalability of models through object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in R.

### Prelude

Using the 5 W's framework (*What*, *Why*, *How*, *Who*, and *When*), this dashboard clarifies its purpose, scope, and benefits:

  - **What:** An examination, study, and learning assistant for actuarial topics, adapted from the latest Society of Actuaries (SOA) syllabus.
  - **Why:** Combines traditional actuarial science with modern data science techniques, enhancing comprehension and retention of complex concepts.
  - **How:** Implemented through Shiny dashboards, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
  - **Who:** Beneficial for actuarial students, educators, and data science enthusiasts.
  - **When:** Usable at any point in the actuarial learning journey.

### Catalog

**§2: Insurable Interest**
  - Definition, application, and identification of long-term life contingent products.
**§3: Survival Models**
  - Covers parametric survival models, life-tables, force of mortality, actuarial notations, and more.
**§4: Life-Contingent Products**
  - Discusses present value valuation, distribution properties, relationships between various products, and impact of survival models.
**§5: Policy Values**
  - Explores future loss random variable, premium values, net, gross, and modified-net premium policies, and impact of changes in survival models.
**§6: Notes**
  - Additional notes and resources for further learning.
